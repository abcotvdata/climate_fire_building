# Weathering Tomorrow - Fire & building data

## Building where we shouldn’t 

### Many areas at high fire risk are also areas seeing housing growth. How do we balance the need for housing while also making sure those homes are safe? 

 
In the next 30 years, one out of every seven properties in the country will be at a major risk for wildfires, according to data from climate risk non-profit First Street Foundation. 

Within some counties, many areas seeing recent growth tend to also be areas with major wildfire risk. 

A higher percentage of properties built later tend to be in higher fire risk counties. About 1 in 20 homes built before 1960 were in counties where more than half of properties are at major risk for wildfire. For homes built after 1970, that number rises to about 1 in 10, according to Census data. 

Wildland Urban Interface, or WUI, is “[areas where human development meets or intermingles with wildland](https://www.usfa.fema.gov/stories/wildland-urban-interface/),” according to FEMA. It’s also land that’s at risk for wildfire and was the [fastest-growing land use type from 1990 to 2010](https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/treesearch/55817), and it has continued to grow in 2020. 

Currently, about [one-third of homes in the contiguous U.S. are in WUI areas](https://silvis.forest.wisc.edu/data/wui-change/), and the areas are growing as more homes are built in and near wilderness areas. Between 1990 and 2020, 14 million more homes were built in WUI areas, a 47% increase. And there are examples of it in areas in each of our markets ([see more here](https://twdc-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/grace_m_manthey_abc_com/EWmC5qVF5kVBiNZHSFZTdSwBUpdEXF0mWmGmkl2cZuWhfQ?e=tf2vWM)). 

In Nevada, the number of homes in these areas has tripled. In Texas, they’ve nearly doubled. In North Carolina, there’s been a 65% increase.  

Even in California, a state that has historically always had wildfire risk, the number of homes in these areas continues to grow – 40% since 1990. 

And as these areas increase, so does the risk of wildfire. 

We looked at parcel data in a county in each of our markets. (Save for the Chicago area, which does not have much measurable wildfire risk.)  

Parcel data is tax information for properties in a certain jurisdiction. It usually includes information on the year the building on the property was built, as well as the use of the building/land.  

We combined this parcel information and matched it to the fire risk data by census tract from First Street Foundation. Then we counted the number and percentage of properties in census tracts with more than 50% at major fire risk by the decade built.

- WUI data by state and county. More info/data dictionary is [here](https://silvis.forest.wisc.edu/data/wui-change/). Source: Silvis Lab, University of Wisconsin-Madison
- Aggregated parcel data for one county in each of our markets. Shows the number of homes built by decade in census tracts where more/less than 50% of properties are at major risk for wildfire. Data from county governments/First Street Foundation.
- Aggregated data for the entire U.S. showing the number of homes built by decade in counties where more/less than 50% of properties are at major risk. Data from the U.S. Census/First Street Foundation. There is also data aggreggated by homes built by decade in counties where more/less than 50% of properties are at moderate risk.
- Aggregated data for California showing new, renewal, and non-renewal insurance policies from 2015-2021 by zip code. Data is from the Califoria Department of Insurance. Percent major and severe fire risk is also included in the data from the First Street foundation.
